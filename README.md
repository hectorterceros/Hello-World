Hello-World
===========

A time-honored tradition
Now, the thing is, i can't just say nonsense here and hope to do a good job. I'm just not that good at keeping someone's attention without anything to say. And I'm very serious about what I say, so it's not really hard for me to not say what I could say, for I feel it's below me. Such a waste of mind, really, bu that's just how it goes.
